# Light alarm

I bought an Espruino and LED light strip a few years ago and just tinkered around with them every now and then, as you do. Then I read a book "Sleep: The Myth of 8 Hours, the Power of Naps... and the New Plan to Recharge Your Body and Mind" by Nick Littlehales. Ohhh, really interesting, especially about how light can affect different hormone releases. This is my little prototype "light buddy", a light that you can synchronize with throughout the day (90 minute cycles).

I had in mind these states:

 * Off state - during night
 * Dawn/sunset - transition from off to deep red (and vice versa) over 90 period before waking/sleep
 * Daylight - blue/white light
 * Firelights - for the evening when winding down, red/amber lights to mimic fire
